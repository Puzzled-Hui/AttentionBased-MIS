# AttentionBased-MIS
Medical Image Segmentation Based on Attention mechanism(Fine-Tune for natural image[semantic/instance] segmentation)
This project is dedicated to 
- Collecting and re-implementing different attention mechanisms,transforming them modular and portable.
- Proposing  novel attention mechanisms tailed for 3D data Segmentation.
Main purpose is used in 3D Medical Image Segmentation.Fine-tune for Other CV task need attention easily meanwhile.

## dataset
Base dataset and derived dataset...[Coming Soon]()



## model
This section include base model(for segmentation or feature extraction) and different attention mechanisms.
Each attention mechanism can recalibrate multi-dim feature maps across their own function domain.
Most attention mechanism can be modularized and integrated into sub feature maps
